        Soon after creating Vacuum and Force, I decided to do another physics based game as a
        high school project, but this time I was also going to submit the game to the spring
        Ludum Dare. The theme of Ludum Dare being 'tiny worlds' and the physics topic being circuits,
        Full Circuit tasked the player with building circuits on small planets using a
        Sokoban-like box pushing mechanic. Once the circuit was completed, the buildings on the
        planet would regain power. It fared average in the competition and, after some feedback, I
        released a new version with better save features after Ludum Dare ended. The music in the
        game was completely computer generated by a program a Ludum Dare contestant put out to other
        jammers. Full Circuit was created with Game Maker.
