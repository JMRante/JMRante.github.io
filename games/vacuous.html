        <em>Vacuous</em> was my largest game development project in college, taking over two years
        to be completed. A tribute to what I had learned in my university physics courses and
        the spiritual successor to one of my first games, <em>Vacuum and Force</em>, <em>Vacuous</em> was my
        first attempt to create a game high quality enough for commercial release. With <em>Vacuous</em>
        I wanted to push my skills in level design, programming, and art. For the soundtrack 
        I hired composer Joseph Elliot, whose score captured the spacey Genesis era vibe I 
        wanted the game to have. <em>Vacuous</em> was created in Game Maker Studio.
