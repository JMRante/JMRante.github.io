        I spent a long period of time trying to develop any video game to completion, always
        failing. I have a folder of around 50 abandoned game projects, all at varying levels
        of incompletion. Finding defeat over and over again was frustrating, but I kept
        learning along the way. My senior year of high school I took a physics course where I
        had the option to create my own project. I decided I would create a short game that
        demonstrated one of the concepts from classical mechanics: acceleration. After a
        single weekend of nearly non-stop work where I had to use all the knowledge I had
        gained so far, I had finished my first game. This was an incredible breakthrough. 
        The result, <em>Vacuum and Force</em>, was a simple 40 stage game where
        the player must guide a ship with thrusters through obstacle courses in space. For my
        first complete game, it was surprisingly a solid creation. It was the first of many
        titles I built using the Game Maker engine.
