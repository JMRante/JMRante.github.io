        I worked on <em>Shuffle Company</em> in various forms on and off for six years. <em>Shuffle Company</em> was 
        intended to be the ultimate 3D puzzle-action game, with a focus on an easy and powerful level 
        editor to enable an ecosystem of user created levels. It was an expansion on the designs of 
        classics like <em>Chip's Challenge</em> and <em>Return to Wonderland</em>. Originally, I attempted to build it 
        in a custom C++ engine, but that proved to be too ambitious and unnecessary, with only an early 
        level editor being made. Then there were several prototypes for it made in Unity, most of which 
        focused on solving problems around creating nice looking, 3D environments on a grid. This proved 
        challenging, and I engineered several approaches to 3D tilesets of this sort, all with different 
        tradeoffs.

        Ultimately, the work culminated in a large, 20 level proof of concept demo. This demo proved the 
        design ideas could work and provide for many interesting possibilities. Since this project had 
        taken so long, still needed a lot of work, and was highly niche, I decided for my own sanity to 
        take an indefinite pause on it. I might someday return to it again as a passion project.
