        Soon after creating <em>Vacuum and Force</em>, I decided to make another physics based game as a
        high school project, but this time I was also going to submit the game to the spring 2012
        Ludum Dare competition. With the theme of Ludum Dare being 'tiny worlds' and the physics topic being circuits,
        <em>Full Circuit</em> tasked the player with building circuits on small planets using a
        <em>Sokoban</em>-like box pushing mechanic. Once the circuit was completed, the buildings on the
        planet would regain power. It fared average in the competition and, after some feedback, I
        released a new version with better save features after Ludum Dare ended. The music in the
        game was completely computer generated by a program a Ludum Dare contestant put out to other
        jammers. <em>Full Circuit</em> was created with Game Maker.
