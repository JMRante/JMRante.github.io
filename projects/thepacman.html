        In elementary school I fell in love with the game <em>Pac-Man: Adventures in Time</em>. In
        middle school, trying to scratch the same itch, I played a large number of Pac-Man
        fan games that I found scattered across the internet. By the time I was a senior in
        high school, I decided I would try to make my own tribute to the classic arcade game.
        Developed over the summer between high school and college, <em>The Pac-Man</em> was the first
        large scale game development project I successfully completed. Perhaps the most
        horribly titled game I ever made (the stupid joke being that this is one of those
        reboots that uses the original's name with 'the' in front), <em>The Pac-Man</em> featured
        over 70 stages set in ten unique environments. The game had a plethora of
        interesting game elements to spice up the typical Pac-Man formula. This was the only
        fan game I would create, though many of my failed projects around this time were also fan games.
        <em>The Pac-Man</em> was created with Game Maker.
