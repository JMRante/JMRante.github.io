        I have always been a big fan of Midnight Synergy's <em>Wonderland</em> series. 
        When I heard they were looking for level designers from the 
        community to collaborate with them on their new game, I had to submit
        an audition. I taught myself how to use the level creation tools and built a decent
        level pack to demonstrate my skills. I got hired and got to work with a wonderful team
        of brilliant puzzle designers. I contributed stages to three parts of the game: the jungle
        canyon, Kaboom village, and the volcano. Beyond this, I also played a role in defining how
        certain areas in the game would look; notably, I came up with the elevation based visual
        style of the opening canyon and jungle canyon areas. I was rather inexperienced when I
        did this work, so while my levels are nice to look at, they do not contain the most
        interesting puzzles in the game. In fact, the stages I designed were some of the easiest
        to solve. <em>Wonderland Adventures: Mysteries of Fire Island</em> can be purchased on Midnight
        Synergy's website.
