        My second semester of college I took a game development course. It provided me a good opportunity to spend 
        an entire semester focused on a large scale game project. I set out to create a game far more ambitious than my 
        previous ones; this time I would develop a game using the 3D capabilities of the Game Maker engine. The
        result of all the hard work was <em>Crawl</em>, a first person dungeon crawler spanning thirty two
        stages throughout eight worlds. Combat and puzzle solving in the game was inspired by the
        systems in the Mario RPGs. <em>Crawl</em>'s story revolved around an interloper entering the minds of
        people in need of psychological intervention, defeating their demons. Working on <em>Crawl</em> taught me a 
        large amount of 3D math and how 3D rendering works. <em>Crawl</em> was created with Game Maker.
